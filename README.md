# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification and Visualization

This repository demonstrates the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification and attention visualization. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for hands-on implementation, offering insights into model predictions and interpretability.

## Features
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A state-of-the-art model for image classification using self-attention mechanisms.
- **Attention Visualization**: Visualize attention maps to interpret how the model makes decisions.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Provides a step-by-step implementation, making it accessible for learning and experimentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vit-classification-visualization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vit-classification-visualization
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "ViT_Classification+Visualization.ipynb"
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load a dataset.
   - Train or fine-tune the Vision Transformer model.
   - Visualize attention maps and understand model predictions.

## Dataset
This notebook is compatible with popular image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet). Ensure the dataset is correctly set up and modify paths as required.
