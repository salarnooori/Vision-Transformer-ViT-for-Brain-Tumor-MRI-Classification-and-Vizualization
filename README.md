# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Brain Tumor MRI Classification and Vizualization

This repository demonstrates the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) for classifying brain tumor MRI scans. It includes a step-by-step implementation using a custom ViT model, showcasing its effectiveness in medical image analysis.

## Features
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Implements a cutting-edge architecture leveraging self-attention mechanisms for image classification.
- **Brain Tumor Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset of MRI scans categorized into four distinct classes.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Includes a Jupyter Notebook for training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Highlights the application of ViT in identifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vit-brain-tumor-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vit-brain-tumor-classification
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "ViT_Classification+Visualization.ipynb"
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the Brain Tumor dataset.
   - Train and fine-tune the ViT model.
   - Visualize predictions and attention maps.

## Dataset
The Brain Tumor dataset contains MRI scans categorized into four classes. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and update file paths in the notebook as needed.

## Results
- Classification accuracy and loss metrics.
- Attention map visualizations highlighting regions of interest in MRI scans.
